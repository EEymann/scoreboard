//PureComponent is a more performant version of component
//It's another way you might see classes written in react
//PureComponent implements a lifecycle method behind the scenes called:
//shouldComponentUpdate that runs a shallow comparison of props and state.
//The lifecycle method automatically checks whether a rerender is required for the component,
//and calls render only if it detects changes in state or props 
//This gives you the chance to skip rerendering when the component state or props haven't changed.
//Now only the player with the updated score will rerender as opposed to the entire list of players.
